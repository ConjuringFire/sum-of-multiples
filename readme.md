Sum of Multiples
===========

### Objective

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. This project provides an interface for the user to find the multiples of any designated numbers below any designated maximum number and return the sum of those numbers.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the index.html file
3. Enter the values to calculate the answer

### Disclaimer

This project was created to build upon the answer to Project Euler Problem 1: "Multiples of 3 and 5". 

Before initiating this project I decided to program using only JavaScript with the exception of the interface which uses CSS and HTML.
